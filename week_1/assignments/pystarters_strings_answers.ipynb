anatomical terms of neuroanatomy [edit on wikidata] this schematic shows an anatomically accurate single pyramidal neuron, the primary excitatory neuron of cerebral cortex, with a synaptic connection from an incoming axon onto a dendritic spine.  a neuron, also known as a neurone (british spelling) and nerve cell, is an electrically excitable cell that receives, processes, and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals. these signals between neurons occur via specialized connections called synapses. neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. neurons are the primary components of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and of the peripheral nervous system, which comprises the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system.  there are many types of specialized neurons. sensory neurons respond to one particular type of stimulus such as touch, sound, or light and all other stimuli affecting the cells of the sensory organs, and converts it into an electrical signal via transduction, which is then sent to the spinal cord or brain. motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to cause everything from muscle contractions and affect glandular outputs. interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord in neural networks.  a typical neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. the term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly in its undifferentiated stage. dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometers and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex \"dendritic tree\". an axon (also called a nerve fiber) is a special cellular extension (process) that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and send out signals down the axon. numerous axons are often bundled into fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire make up cables). bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called tracts. the cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. at the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. there are, however, many exceptions to these rules: for example, neurons can lack dendrites, or have no axon, and synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.  all neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels. if the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated and this change in cross-membrane potential travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives.  in most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells during brain development and childhood. neurons in the adult brain generally do not undergo cell division. astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency. neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain. however, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.[1][2]  contents      1 overview     2 anatomy and histology         2.1 histology and internal structure     3 classification         3.1 structural classification

centre of this mass is the nucleus and the branches are dendrites. a thick axon trails away from the mass, ending with further branching which are labeled as axon terminals. along the axon are a number of protuberances labeled as myelin sheaths. dendrite soma axon nucleus node of ranvier axon terminal schwann cell myelin sheath drawing of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum, by spanish

the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. dendrites typically branch profusely, getting thinner with each branching, and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma. the axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock, and can extend for great distances, giving rise to hundreds of branches. unlike dendrites, an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends. the soma may give rise to numerous dendrites, but never to more than one axon. synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon. a typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another. synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory. if the net excitation received by a neuron over a short period of time is large enough, the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential, which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon, activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes.  many neurons fit the foregoing schema in every respect, but there are also exceptions to most parts of it. there are no neurons that lack a soma, but there are neurons that lack dendrites, and others that lack an axon. furthermore, in addition to the typical axodendritic and axosomatic synapses, there are axoaxonic (axon-to-axon) and dendrodendritic (dendrite-to-dendrite) synapses.  the key to neural function is the synaptic signaling process, which is partly electrical and partly chemical. the electrical aspect depends on properties of the neuron's membrane. like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. a lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. these include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that actively transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. the interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. this voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.  neurons communicate by chemical and electrical synapses in a process known as neurotransmission, also called synaptic transmission. the fundamental process that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is the action potential, a propagating electrical signal that is generated by exploiting the electrically excitable membrane of the neuron. this is also known as a wave of depolarization. anatomy and histology diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron  neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. for instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.[4]      the soma is the body of the neuron. as it contains the nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. the nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.[5]     the dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. this overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. this is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine.     the axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. the axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. the part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. this makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative action potential threshold. while the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.     the axon terminal contains synapses, specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons.  the accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.  axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. the soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. the longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.  sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).  fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic;[6] however, research starting around 2002 shows that additional neurons throughout the brain can originate from neural stem cells through the process of neurogenesis. these are found throughout the brain, but are particularly concentrated in the subventricular zone and subgranular zone.[7] histology and internal structure golgi-stained neurons in human hippocampal tissue actin filaments in a mouse cortical neuron in culture  numerous microscopic clumps called nissl substance (or nissl bodies) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (\"base-loving\") dye. these structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal rna. named after german psychiatrist and neuropathologist franz nissl (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) haematoxylin [8] highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal rna.  the cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which are assembled into larger neurofibrils. some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age.[9][10][11] other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development.  there are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. typical axons almost never contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment. dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases. classification image of pyramidal neurons in mouse cerebral cortex expressing green fluorescent protein. the red staining indicates gabaergic interneurons.[12] smi32-stained pyramidal neurons in cerebral cortex see also: list of distinct cell types in the adult human body § nervous system  neurons exist in a number of different shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function.[13] the anatomist camillo golgi grouped neurons into two types; type i with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type ii with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. type i cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located. the basic morphology of type i neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the myelin sheath. around the cell body is a branching dendritic tree that receives signals from other neurons. the end of the axon has branching terminals (axon terminal) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron. \n",

A neuron, also known as a neurone (British spelling) and nerve cell, is an electrically excitable cell that receives, processes, and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals. These signals between neurons occur via specialized connections called synapses. Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the primary components of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and of the peripheral nervous system, which comprises the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system.  There are many types of specialized neurons. Sensory neurons respond to one particular type of stimulus such as touch, sound, or light and all other stimuli affecting the cells of the sensory organs, and converts it into an electrical signal via transduction, which is then sent to the spinal cord or brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to cause everything from muscle contractions and affect glandular outputs. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord in neural networks.  A typical neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly in its undifferentiated stage. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometers and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex \"dendritic tree\". An axon (also called a nerve fiber) is a special cellular extension (process) that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and send out signals down the axon. Numerous axons are often bundled into fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire make up cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called tracts. The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: for example, neurons can lack dendrites, or have no axon, and synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.  All neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated and this change in cross-membrane potential travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives.  In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells during brain development and childhood. Neurons in the adult brain generally do not undergo cell division. Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency. Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain. However, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.[1][2]  Contents  1 Overview 2 Anatomy and histology 2.1 Histology and internal structure 3 Classification 3.1 Structural classification 3.1.1 Polarity 3.1.2 Other 3.2 Functional classification 3.2.1 Direction 3.2.2 Action on other neurons 3.2.3 Discharge patterns 3.2.4 Classification by neurotransmitter production 4 Connectivity 5 Mechanisms for propagating action potentials 6 Neural coding 7 All-or-none principle 8 History 8.1 Neuron doctrine 9 Neurons in the brain 10 Neurological disorders 10.1 Demyelination 10.2 Axonal degeneration 11 Neurogenesis 12 Nerve regeneration 13 See also 14 References 15 Further reading 16 External links  Overview Structure of a typical neuron Neuron (peripheral nervous system) At one end of an elongated structure is a branching mass. At the centre of this mass is the nucleus and the branches are dendrites. A thick axon trails away from the mass, ending with further branching which are labeled as axon terminals. Along the axon are a number of protuberances labeled as myelin sheaths.

(A) denotes Purkinje cells and (B) denotes granule cells, both of which are multipolar. Neuron cell body  A neuron is a specialized type of cell found in the bodies of all eumetozoans. Only sponges and a few other simpler animals lack neurons. The features that define a neuron are electrical excitability[3] and the presence of synapses, which are complex membrane junctions that transmit signals to other cells. The body's neurons, plus the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support, together constitute the nervous system. In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea.  A typical neuron is divided into three parts: the soma or cell body, dendrites, and axon. The soma is usually compact; the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. Dendrites typically branch profusely, getting thinner with each branching, and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock, and can extend for great distances, giving rise to hundreds of branches. Unlike dendrites, an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends. The soma may give rise to numerous dendrites, but never to more than one axon. Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon. A typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory. If the net excitation received by a neuron over a short period of time is large enough, the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential, which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon, activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes.  Many neurons fit the foregoing schema in every respect, but there are also exceptions to most parts of it. There are no neurons that lack a soma, but there are neurons that lack dendrites, and others that lack an axon. Furthermore, in addition to the typical axodendritic and axosomatic synapses, there are axoaxonic (axon-to-axon) and dendrodendritic (dendrite-to-dendrite) synapses.  The key to neural function is the synaptic signaling process, which is partly electrical and partly chemical. The electrical aspect depends on properties of the neuron's membrane. Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that actively transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.  Neurons communicate by chemical and electrical synapses in a process known as neurotransmission, also called synaptic transmission. The fundamental process that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is the action potential, a propagating electrical signal that is generated by exploiting the electrically excitable membrane of the neuron. This is also known as a wave of depolarization. Anatomy and histology Diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron  Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.[4]  The soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.[5] The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine. The axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative action potential threshold. While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons. The axon terminal contains synapses, specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons.  The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.  Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.  Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).  Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic;[6] however, research starting around 2002 shows that additional neurons throughout the brain can originate from neural stem cells through the process of neurogenesis. These are found throughout the brain, but are particularly concentrated in the subventricular zone and subgranular zone.[7] Histology and internal structure Golgi-stained neurons in human hippocampal tissue Actin filaments in a mouse Cortical Neuron in culture  Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl substance (or Nissl bodies) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (\"base-loving\") dye. These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA. Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) haematoxylin [8] highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.  The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age.[9][10][11] Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development.  There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons almost never contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.

The red staining indicates GABAergic interneurons.[12] SMI32-stained pyramidal neurons in cerebral cortex See also: List of distinct cell types in the adult human body § Nervous system  Neurons exist in a number of different shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function.[13] The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the myelin sheath. Around the cell body is a branching dendritic tree that receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching terminals (axon terminal) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.\n",

incoming axon onto a dendritic spine   A neuron  also known as a neurone  British spelling  and nerve cell  is an electrically excitable cell that receives  processes  and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals  These signals between neurons occur via specialized connections called synapses  Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks  Neurons are the primary components of the central nervous system  which includes the brain and spinal cord  and of the peripheral nervous system  which comprises the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system   There are many types of specialized neurons  Sensory neurons respond to one particular type of stimulus such as touch  sound  or light and all other stimuli affecting the cells of the sensory organs  and converts it into an electrical signal via transduction  which is then sent to the spinal cord or brain  Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to cause everything from muscle contractions and affect glandular outputs  Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord in neural networks   A typical neuron consists of a cell body  soma   dendrites  and an axon  The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon  particularly in its undifferentiated stage  Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body  often extending for hundreds of micrometers and branching multiple times  giving rise to a complex  dendritic tree   An axon  also called a nerve fiber  is a special cellular extension  process  that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance  as far as   meter in humans or even more in other species  Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and send out signals down the axon  Numerous axons are often bundled into fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system  like strands of wire make up cables   Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called tracts  The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites  but never to more than one axon  although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates  At the majority of synapses  signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another  There are  however  many exceptions to these rules  for example  neurons can lack dendrites  or have no axon  and synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite   All neurons are electrically excitable  due to maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps  which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular versus extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium  potassium  chloride  and calcium  Changes in the cross membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage dependent ion channels  If the voltage changes by a large enough amount  an all or none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated and this change in cross membrane potential travels rapidly along the cell s axon  and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives   In most cases  neurons are generated by special types of stem cells during brain development and childhood  Neurons in the adult brain generally do not undergo cell division  Astrocytes are star shaped glial cells that have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency  Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain  However  there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in two brain areas  the hippocampus and olfactory

this mass is the nucleus and the branches are dendrites  A thick axon trails away from the mass  ending with further branching which are labeled as axon terminals  Along the axon are a number of protuberances labeled as myelin sheaths  Dendrite Soma Axon Nucleus Node of Ranvier Axon terminal Schwann cell Myelin sheath Drawing of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum  by Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal in        A  denotes Purkinje cells and  B  denotes granule cells  both of which are multipolar  Neuron cell body  A neuron is a specialized type of cell found in the bodies of all eumetozoans  Only sponges and a few other simpler animals lack neurons  The features that define a neuron are electrical excitability    and the presence of synapses  which are complex membrane junctions that transmit signals to other cells  The body s neurons  plus the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support  together constitute the nervous system  In vertebrates  the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system  but some reside in peripheral ganglia  and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea   A typical neuron is divided into three parts  the soma or cell body  dendrites  and axon  The soma is usually compact  the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it  Dendrites typically branch profusely  getting thinner with each branching  and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma  The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock  and can extend for great distances  giving rise to hundreds of branches  Unlike dendrites  an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends  The soma may give rise to numerous dendrites  but never to more than one axon  Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites  signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon  A typical synapse  then  is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another  Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory  If the net excitation received by a neuron over a short period of time is large enough  the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential  which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon  activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes   Many neurons fit the foregoing schema in every respect  but there are also exceptions to most parts of it  There are no neurons that lack a soma  but there are neurons that lack dendrites  and others that lack an axon  Furthermore  in addition to the typical axodendritic and axosomatic synapses  there are axoaxonic  axon to axon  and dendrodendritic  dendrite to dendrite  synapses   The key to neural function is the synaptic signaling process  which is partly electrical and partly chemical  The electrical aspect depends on properties of the neuron s membrane  Like all animal cells  the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane  a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it  A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator  but in neurons  many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active  These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that actively transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other  Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions  Some ion channels are voltage gated  meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane  Others are chemically gated  meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid  The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane  typically a bit less than      of a volt at baseline  This voltage has two functions  first  it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane  second  it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane   Neurons communicate by chemical and electrical synapses in a process known as neurotransmission  also called synaptic transmission  The fundamental process that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is the action potential  a propagating electrical signal that is generated by exploiting the electrically excitable membrane of the neuron  This is also known as a wave of depolarization  Anatomy and histology Diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron  Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals  Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system  there is a wide variety in their shape  size  and electrochemical properties  For instance  the soma of a neuron can vary from   to     micrometers in diameter      The soma is the body of the neuron  As it contains the nucleus  most protein synthesis occurs here  The nucleus can range from   to    micrometers in diameter     The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches  This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree  This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine  The axon is a finer  cable like projection that can extend tens  hundreds  or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length  The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma  and also carries some types of information back to it   Many neurons have only one axon  but this axon may and usually will undergo extensive branching  enabling communication with many target cells  The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock  Besides being an anatomical structure  the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage dependent sodium channels  This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon  in electrophysiological terms  it has the most negative action potential threshold  While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow  this region can also receive input from other neurons  The axon terminal contains synapses  specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons   The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components  however  dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so called main function   Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick  while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker  The soma is usually about       micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains  The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long  reaching from the base of the spine to the toes   Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord  over     meters in adults  Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks  Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon  an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size        millimeters thick  several centimeters long    Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic     however  research starting around      shows that additional neurons throughout the brain can originate from neural stem cells through the process of neurogenesis  These are found throughout the brain  but are particularly concentrated in the subventricular zone and subgranular zone     Histology and
