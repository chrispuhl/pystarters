Requirements
============

If you want to be able to run the code for this assignement, you will need
scikit-image and opencv2

Installation
============
For unixes (Mac/linux):
  #. Create a pyton2.7 conda environment
  #. Source activate the environment
  #. Install the required libraries except opencv
  #. Install opencv from the conda-forge channel version 2.4.13.4

For windows:
    The simplest solution is to fix the code to work with python3 and opencv3
as opencv 2.4.13.4 is not available on windows

Assignment
=========

To complete in any order (the order only matters if you run it on windows (seee above))
  * Fix the code to work with python3
  * Fix the code to work with opencv3
  * Fix the style of the code following style guidelines practices as described in the eponymous document
